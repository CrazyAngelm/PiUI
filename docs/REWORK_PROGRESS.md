# PiUI rework progress log

Branch: `rework/piui-2`. Plan: [PLAN_2026-09-26_RU.md](PLAN_2026-09-26_RU.md).
Decisions: §13 of the plan (owner delegated all decisions on 2026-09-26).
Hard requirement from the owner: **Claude Code runs only on the user's Claude
subscription** (never API keys / Bedrock / Vertex), see plan §8.4.

## Done

- `c77dd2d` — pending UX-audit fixes committed.
- `fb50cef` — host clients go through `host-api/transport.ts`; browser runs use the
  lazily loaded UI Lab host (`host-api/lab/`).
- `3ad1eb0` — design tokens v2 + accessible primitives (`src/lib/ui`, bits-ui,
  Lucide); dev gallery at `?view=gallery`.
- `0fff8f7` — new default shell (`src/app/shell`): sidebar (projects → chats,
  Inbox, Pipelines, Runs, Automations, Settings), composer-first Home, chat view
  with details panel and inline approvals, Inbox, sectioned Settings, Ctrl+K
  palette; runes store with per-frame event batching; lazy views; gzip asset
  budget. Old shell at `?view=legacy`.
- `ce2176c` — rebuilt chat composer (outbox, steer/follow-up, slash commands,
  model/reasoning/fast chip) + Russian dictionary `features/locale/shellRu.ts`.
- `3bb7b5f` — merged bridge fixes: Pi tool output/select dialogs/compaction,
  Hermes follow-up queue and failed-turn recovery, Codex MCP/dynamic tools.
- `3f6c6c6` — Codex-style transcript: activity summaries with RU plurals, typed
  tool rows, unified diff viewer, answer actions, paging + content-visibility,
  in-chat history search (Ctrl+F).
- `05f45f2`, `3df6019` — pipeline editor rebuilt on Svelte Flow (`src/app/pipelines`):
  agent/router cards, typed edges (result/route/messages/observe/delegate),
  inspector tabs, templates (chain, parallel, orchestrator, review loop, router),
  undo/redo, dagre auto-layout, check/save/run; Russian copy.
- `76864aa` — stateful deterministic UI Lab host (`?lab=demo|empty|safe|long`):
  workspace sessions, composer, orchestration run engine, schedules.
- `b5fab9f`, `86305bb`, `eaff6ea`, `455ea4f`, `dbdd42e` (merge `e945a63`) — host
  stability: native starts outside the global gate, event backpressure instead
  of fatal queue overflow, batched usage writes, orchestration reads off the main
  thread, manual runs resume after restart.
- `139572b`, `13d236c` — browser QA fixes: epoch timestamps, trust via transport,
  transcript follow logic, compact tool narration, GitHub tables in safe
  Markdown, palette focus, sidebar overflow.
- `08a9778` — n8n-style run view (`src/app/runs`): run list, read-only run canvas
  with recorded step states, live activity, loop attempts and spawned helpers;
  step panel with result, conversation, inputs, attempts, usage and operator
  actions (approve/reject, run again from here, cancel, retry, record outcome).
  Svelte upgraded to 5.57.1 (5.38 emitted invalid JS for optional TS params).
- `15824b6` (merge `15e9d74`) — Claude Code bridge adapter (`bridge/claude.mjs`):
  headless stream-json + control protocol, subscription-only verification,
  approvals, AskUserQuestion, steer, resume from native JSONL; 28 tests.

- `ab5bc58`, `d5c571c` — orchestration v6.1 (additive): run inputs
  (`{{input.name}}`, typed start form) and review loop limits
  (`maxIterations`; at the limit the task waits for a person).
- `9d041fd` — pipeline assistant in the editor: read-only builder chat that
  proposes whole-graph changes, validated and applied in place.
- `35dafa6` — Automations screen in the new shell (cards, on/off, edit, delete).
- `db7870a`, `5b8004c` — run inputs and review limits across the editor (Start
  node, inputs editor, run form), Runs (inputs, "accept last result" / "one more
  round") and Automations (inputs for every run); lab assistant proposals.
- `1db2a11` — day-of-week schedules (host v7.1 `calendar` trigger on chrono-tz,
  DST-safe) with "On days" mode, presets and next-run preview.
- `32b1a65` — Codex verified range 0.147.0–0.158.0 instead of exact pins,
  app-server protocol audit fixes (settings, warnings, `currentTime/read`).
- `86b8e98` — Claude Code as a first-class harness on the subscription only:
  launcher/version range, wide env scrub, Fast pinned off, extra-usage guard,
  sign-in status, pipeline delegation through PiUI, native history projection.
- `main` fast-forwarded to `rework/piui-2` (local only, not pushed).

## In progress

- Engine for one-shot LLM and script steps (`feat/step-executors`, not merged).

## Known issues found on the way

- Codex asks for MCP tool approvals via `mcpServer/elicitation/request`; the
  bridge answers with an error, so such MCP tools are always declined.
- A pipeline step whose first Claude Code launch hits a signed-out CLI is
  recorded as "outcome uncertain"; later steps are refused cleanly.
- The standalone `claude` CLI on this machine is signed out; PiUI shows a
  sign-in hint until the user runs `claude` → `/login`.
- Codex command output is unbounded in the bridge; a non-string Pi input
  placeholder would break Rust parsing.
